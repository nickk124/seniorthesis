\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{cha:section_abstract}
Fitting a statistical model to data is one of the most important tools in any scientific or data-driven field, and rigorously fitting a two dimensional model to data that has intrinsic uncertainties (error bars) in both the independent variable and the dependent variable is a daunting task, especially if the data also has extrinsic uncertainty (sample variance) that cannot be fully accounted for by the error bars. Here, I introduce a novel statistic (described as the Trotter, Reichart, Konz statistic, or TRK) developed in \textcite{trotter} that is advantageous towards model-fitting in this ``worst-case data'' scenario, especially when compared to other methods. I implemented this statistic as a suite of fitting algorithms in C++ that comes equipped with many capabilities, including: support for any nonlinear model; probability distribution generation, correlation removal and custom priors for model parameters; asymmetric uncertainties in the data and/or model, and more. I also built an end-to-end website through which the algorithm can be used easily, but generally, with a high degree of customizability. The statistic is applicable to practically any data-driven field, and I show a few examples of its usage within the realm of astronomy. This thesis along with \textcite{trotter} form the foundations for \textcite{TRKIapjs}, in preparation. The TRK source code and web-based calculator can be found at \url{https://github.com/nickk124/TRK} and \url{https://skynet.unc.edu/rcr/calculator/trk}, respectively.
